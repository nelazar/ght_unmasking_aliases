# GitHub alias merging script

This script tries to identify different aliases, i.e., ([optional `login`], `name`, `email`) tuples, used by the same person in GitHub / [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org) data.

There are several reasons why multiple aliases occur. 
For example, since on GitHub the name and email address of committers and authors are set locally in each developer's git client, rather than globally at GitHub level, there is variation in these attributes across devices and time. Moreover, GHTorrent may introduce artificial user accounts when encountering contributions by "unknown" users while crawling data from GitHub's API.

## Input

**Update:** A `csv` file featuring columns `uid`, `name`, `email`, `login`\*, `location`\*, and `user_type`\*.

\* optional

~~A `csv` file or database table such as `users` in [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/relational.html). See the [Alias](https://github.com/bvasiles/ght_unmasking_aliases/blob/e1d22184aeeff7cbc91eadee542d3e63353fb643/alias.py#L7) class for possible fields.~~

**Important**: each alias must have a unique numeric id. The script will produce a map of alias ids to person ids.

## Internals

The script:

- For every pair of aliases, collects clues that could indicate the aliases belong to the same person, e.g., the `email` address is the same, the `name` is the same, or the prefix of the `email` address matches the user's `login`. See [here](https://github.com/bvasiles/ght_unmasking_aliases/blob/e1d22184aeeff7cbc91eadee542d3e63353fb643/mergeAliases.py#L160-L253).

- Creates clusters of aliases that share clues, as candidates for merging. See [here](https://github.com/bvasiles/ght_unmasking_aliases/blob/e1d22184aeeff7cbc91eadee542d3e63353fb643/mergeAliases.py#L298-L313).

- Uses heuristics to decide whether each of the previous clusters is valid. For example, if all have the same `email` then the cluster is considered valid and all candidates are merged. Similarly, if all candidates in the cluster have the same `full name` and `email domain` (after clearer options have been exhausted) then the cluster is considered valid and all candidates are merged. See [here](https://github.com/bvasiles/ght_unmasking_aliases/blob/e1d22184aeeff7cbc91eadee542d3e63353fb643/mergeAliases.py#L318-L388).

## Output

There are three main files generated by the script.

- `idm_map.csv` is a map of alias user ids (first column) to the unique person id (second column). 

- `idm_log.csv` is a log file with information on what aliases have been merged and *why*, i.e., what clues were used to make that decision.

- `idm_maybe.csv` is another log file, with identical structure to `idm_log.csv`, listing all the clusters that could have potentially been validated (candidate aliases for merging) because they also share clues. However, as the heuristics are implemented now, they haven't been merged.

**Important**: Carefully inspect these files manually. If you observe (many) false positives in `idm_log.csv`, it means the [heuristics](https://github.com/bvasiles/ght_unmasking_aliases/blob/e1d22184aeeff7cbc91eadee542d3e63353fb643/mergeAliases.py#L318-L388) were too greedy and should be made more conservative. If instead you observe (many) false negatives in `idm_maybe.csv`, it means the [heuristics](https://github.com/bvasiles/ght_unmasking_aliases/blob/e1d22184aeeff7cbc91eadee542d3e63353fb643/mergeAliases.py#L318-L388) were too conservative and can be made more greedy.
